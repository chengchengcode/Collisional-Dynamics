# collisional_dynamics

Here is a paper http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978Icar...34..227G describing "The velocity dispersion in Saturn's rings".

It seems for the old papers, people would like to show the results in the first section. 

This paper shows me how to deal with the collision term in Boltzmann equation.

I derived the fomulars in this marvel paper.

Elsarticle_Planet.pdf	shows the main idea of the derivation. I cannot find the pdf for Goldreich1978 just now. I hope this pdf can make my point. Based on this pdf, I write a paper to describe the planetesimal dynamics, which is rejected by ICARUS.

This pdf reminds me that how lonely I was when I start my astronomy study.
