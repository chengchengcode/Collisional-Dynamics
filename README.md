# collisional_dynamics

Here is a paper http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978Icar...34..227G describing "The velocity dispersion in Saturn's rings".

It seems for the old papers, people would like to show the results in the first section. 

This paper shows me how to deal with the collision term in Boltzmann equation.

I derived the fomulars in this marvel paper.

The files will be uploaded before Oct. 15.
